                    <p>The International Workshop on Fairness in Software Systems (Fairness’2025) is a unique event bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners for exchanging experiences, solutions, and new ideas in applying methods, techniques and tools from software analysis, evolution and re-engineering to advance the state of the art in software fairness.</p>
                    <p>We welcome articles presenting novel and strong contributions to deal with software fairness, including (i) state-of-the-art methods, models, and tools (with evidence of use and study of practical impact) or bridging the gap between practice and research, (ii) empirical studies in the field, addressing one or many human, technical, social, and economic issues of software fairness through qualitative and/or quantitative analyses, and (iii) industrial experiences, including good practices and lessons learned from managing software fairness in specific contexts or domains.</p>
                    <p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Bias in Machine Learning Models:</b> Identifying and mitigating bias in training data; Algorithmic fairness and bias detection techniques; Case studies of bias in deployed systems.</li>
