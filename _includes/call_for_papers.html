                    <b><p>Update: Authors with papers accepted in the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to an open call for a Special Issue on Software Fairness in the Information and Software Technology Journal.</p></b>
                    <br>
                    <p>In contemporary society, technology plays an important role in various domains, including work, education, politics, and leisure. Consequently, without a robust commitment to fairness in software engineering across education, research, and industry, software products may inadvertently inflict harm, particularly by marginalizing certain user groups. Today, as AI systems become more widespread, the expectation for software to represent society’s diversity is not just a technical requirement, but an ethical responsibility. In this context, software fairness has become an essential non-functional requirement and quality attribute, especially for data-driven systems.</p>
                    <p>Software fairness involves ensuring that software systems, algorithms, and their outcomes are equitable, just, and unbiased across all user demographics, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. In software engineering, this entails the prevention of discrimination, the promotion of equitable outcomes, and the systematic mitigation of biases throughout the design, development, deployment, and usage phases of software systems. However, despite the critical importance of these considerations, progress in advancing software fairness has been gradual.</p>
                    <p>The International Workshop on Fairness in Software Systems (Fairness’2025) is a unique event that brings together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange experiences, solutions, and new ideas, combining both technical and societal aspects to advance the state of the art in software fairness. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Bias in Machine Learning Models:</b> Identifying and mitigating bias in training data; Algorithmic fairness and bias detection techniques; Case studies of bias in deployed systems.</li>
                        <li><b>Fairness in AI and Machine Learning:</b> Definitions and metrics of fairness; Fairness-aware machine learning algorithms; Trade-offs between fairness and other performance metrics.</li>
                        <li><b>Ethical Implications of Software Fairness:</b> Ethical considerations in AI development and deployment; Societal impact of unfair software.</li>
                        <li><b>Transparency and Accountability in Software:</b> Explainable AI and interpretability of machine learning models; Auditing and monitoring AI systems for fairness; Accountability mechanisms for software developers and organizations.</li>
                        <li><b>Data Collection and Preprocessing for Fairness:</b> Techniques for collecting unbiased and representative data; Data preprocessing methods to ensure fairness; Handling missing data and data augmentation for fairness.</li>
                        <li><b>Fairness in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):</b> Designing user interfaces that promote fairness; User perception and trust in fair AI systems; Inclusive design practices and accessibility considerations.</li>
                        <li><b>Mitigating Fairness Issues in Software Development Lifecycle:</b> Integrating fairness checks in the software development process; Tools and frameworks for developing fair software; Best practices for collaborative and inclusive development teams.</li>
                        <li><b>Evaluating and Benchmarking Fairness:</b> Standard datasets and benchmarks for fairness evaluation; Comparative studies of fairness metrics and algorithms; Real-world deployment and evaluation of fairness interventions.</li>
                        <li><b>Software Fairness Debt:</b> Definition and conceptualization of software fairness debt; Impact of fairness debt on long-term system performance and trust; Identifying and Measuring Fairness Debt; Managing and Mitigating Fairness Debt; Economic and Organizational Impact of Fairness Debt; Technical Approaches to Fairness Debt Remediation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We welcome articles presenting novel and strong contributions to deal with software fairness, including (i) state-of-the-art methods, models, and tools (with evidence of use and study of practical impact) or bridging the gap between practice and research, (ii) empirical studies in the field, addressing one or many human, technical, social, and economic issues of software fairness through qualitative and/or quantitative analyses, and (iii) industrial experiences, including good practices and lessons learned from managing software fairness in specific contexts or domains.</p>
